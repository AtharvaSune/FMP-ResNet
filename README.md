# ResNet + Fractional Max Pooling

This repository implements two research papers for state of the art Convolutional Neural Networks on the CIFAR - 10 dataset. Further, these two models have been combined to form a hybrid model. 

## Introduction

### ResNet
..*ResNet is a fairly recent architecture (2015) which has surpassed human level
performance on the ImageNet dataset.
..*ResNet solves the problem of vanishing gradients that occurs in many deep
CNN, via implementing skip connections.
..*Typical skip connections are built over 2 or 3 layers. That is a skip connection is
present every 2 or 3 layers.
